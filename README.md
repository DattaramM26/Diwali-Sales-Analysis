Box: The box represents the interquartile range (IQR), which contains the middle 50% of the data.
The top and bottom edges of the box represent the first quartile (Q1) and the third quartile (Q3), respectively. The height of the box is the IQR.
Whiskers: The lines (whiskers) extend from the box to the smallest and largest values within a certain distance from the quartiles.
Outliers: Individual data points beyond the whiskers are considered outliers and are plotted individually.
Median (line inside the box): The line inside the box represents the median value of the data.
